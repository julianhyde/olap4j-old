olap4j release check-list
=========================

  - Update README.txt, CHANGES.txt, index.html.

  - Update build.properties

  - Edit test.properties and run the test suite. Make sure everything is green.
    Also make sure to run both the Mondrian and the XMLA TCKs.

  - Make sure that you have all of the following Java JVMs installed
    separately:

     * Java 1.5
     * Java 1.6
     * Java 1.7

    If you are building on a Linux/Unix/Whatever machine, you should create
    symlinks /usr/lib/jvm/${jdkVersion} where jdkVersion is one of 1.5, 1.6 or
    1.7.

  - Update buildOnJdk.sh (or buildOnJdk.bat if you are building on Windows).

    Important: Uncomment the "case" expression that sets JAVA_HOME. (These days
    buildOnJdk is configured to work out-of-the-box for developers building for
    just one JDK, whereas for a release you need it to build for 3 JDKs.)

    If you are building on a Windows system, including Cygwin users, edit the
    Batch file and set the properties JAVA_HOME_1* to the paths of the
    corresponding JVM installation paths. You can also set these variables in
    your system environment.

  - Make sure that the Java 1.5 is the default JDK on the system path.

  - Run a test build:

      $ ant clean-all dist

    Pay close attention to the Ant targets named compileJdk1.5, compileJdk1.6
    and compileJdk1.7, and ensure that each JVM compilation phase has compiled
    the files it needed to. The JDK 1.5 should compile about 700+ files. The JDK
    1.6 must compile the JDBC 4.0 classes (2 files) and JDK 1.7 should compile
    the JDBC 4.1 driver (1 file). In each compileJdk1.x target, the first target
    is called "apologise:", and must produce no output.

    Check the Javadoc warnings, and make sure that the only warnings are related
    to the JDBC 4 and 4.1 classes. Any other error/warning must be fixed.

  - Check the zip file.

      * Make sure that it contains all the required files.
      * Make sure that the Javadoc links work correctly.
      * Make sure that all JAR files are present.

 - Update README.txt, CHANGES.txt, index.html.

 - Update build.properties

 - Edit test.properties and run the test suite. Make sure everything is green.
   Also make sure to run both the Mondrian and the XMLA TCKs.

 - Make sure that you have all of the following Java JVM's installed
   separately:

    * Java 5
    * Java 6
    * Java 7

  - Update buildOnJdk.[sh|bat].

    If you are building on a Linux/Unix/Whatever machine, you only need to create
    symlinks to /usr/lib/jvm/${jdkVersion} where jdkVersion is one of 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7.

    If you are building on a Windows system, including Cygwin users, edit the Batch
    file and set the properties JAVA_HOME_1* to the paths of the corresponding JVM
    installation paths. You can also set these variables in your system environment.

  - Make sure that the JVM 5 is the default JVM on the system path.

  - Run a test build: $ ant clean-all dist
  
    Pay close attention to the Ant targets named compileJdk1* and ensure that each
    JVM compilation phase has compiled the files it needed to. The JDK 1.5 should compile
    about 800+ files. The JDK 1.6 must compile the JDBC 4.0 classes (2 files)
    and Java 7 should compile the JDBC 4.1 driver (1 file).

    Check the Javadoc warnings, and make sure that the only warnings are related to
    the JDBC 4 and 4.1 classes. Any other error/warning must be fixed.

  - Check the zip file.
  
      * Make sure that it contains all the required files.
      * Make sure that the Javadoc links work correctly.
      * Make sure that all JAR files are present.

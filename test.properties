# This is the default repo file to allow CI builds to function properly.
# Please do not commit any changes on it.
#
# SPECIAL NOTE.
# If the TCK is launched within Ant, the default amount of memory that
# is allowed for Ant won't do the job. There are lots of OLAP operations
# to perform and it is strongly suggested to give at lease 1 gig of ram
# to Ant in order to run properly. You can easily achieve this by setting
# ANT_OPTS environment variable to "-Xmx1024m".
